              My introduction into the industry started with a conversation with
              a calculus tutor of mine. He advised me that to build AI
              applications I should study electrical engineering. After my first
              year, I discovered that my abilities were more suited for
              hardware/software development so I pivoted to computer engineering
              while still honing my skills in machine learning and software
              engineering. Which leads me to where I am now, an individual
              motivated to deliver AI powered solutions.

              During my time outside of work, I enjoy learning. Right now I am
              reading through Advanced Portfolio Management A Quantâ€™s Guide for
              Fundamental Investors - Giuseppe A. Paleologo. Coming from an
              engineering background it is somewhat of a hard read but I enjoy
              overcoming challenges. As I read through the textbook I try to use
              the concepts learned to build modules with the end goal to build a{" "}

              I have climbed so far is a V3, so not that good yet. Martial arts

              from the ages of 16-18. I had to take a hiatus from training since
              I got busy with school, but recently switched over into Kickboxing
              and Muay Thai. The transition has been really smooth, and I have
              got to say that there is much more freedom in strategy and
              techniques. Both sports require strategies that play to my
              strengths but also tuned to the current problem.
